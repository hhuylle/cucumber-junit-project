/*
What are the advantages of Cucumber?
Cucumber acceptance tests are written from the userâ€™s perspective

Tests are written in plain-text English so people with less technical skills can also write scenarios

Team Collaboration (Product owners, business analysts, developers, testers are all involved in writing scenarios)
